Statistics on the lake vary with the seasons, but the lake is six miles across at its widest and has a maximum depth of 1,949 feet. This makes it the deepest lake in the United States, second deepest in North America, and the ninth deepest in the world. Crater Lake is the deepest lake on the planet whose floor lies above sea level.\r\n\r\nCrater Lake is renowned for its intense blue color and its clarity. This is a result of a lack of sediment in the lake as there are no inflowing watercourses: the lake nestles within a massive caldera that filled with rain and snow melt (The area experiences some of the highest snowfall totals in the world). Most days, it is possible to see at least 100 feet below the surface.",
