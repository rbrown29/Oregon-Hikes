      "description": "Angels Rest is an exposed bluff on the western end of the Columbia River Gorge. The platy andesite that composes this promontory is part of a million-year-old lava flow from Larch Mountain, a member of the Boring Lava Field. The summit is characterized by a long, rocky spine surrounded on three sides by cliffs, boasting a striking 270 degree view! While you can't see any of the Cascade volcanoes from the top, you do get great vantages of Beacon Rock, Silver Star Mountain, and many other landmarks. The real draw, however, is the perspective of the Columbia River below - like you're on a balcony over a great auditorium. Its 1500 foot prominence and its proximity to the Columbia River give you the false sensation that you could dive from Angels Rest to the water below!",

However, once away from the main attractions, you will find back trails that are relatively unpopulated. The route of this hike covers the northern part of the 640-acre state park (see the Misery Ridge Loop Hike for the southern section). Once you’ve admired the landscape from the Monkey Face Viewpoint and have descended to the Summit Trail, you’ll get a few quiet miles and a secluded viewpoint before hitting more human traffic on the Burma Road. There are many spots with incredible views on this hike and, as always, the tuff walls that attract climbers from all over the world perform their photogenic magic for more casual visitors as well.",

Over the last thousand years, the falls have carved a majestic basin here, plunging 160 feet from towering basalt cliffs to the rushing creek bed below. While this scene is impressive enough, the most bewildering aspect of the falls in the passageway behind them. Trail builders from the early 1900s blasted a tunnel behind the falls and then across the sheer rock face on their far side, making this area the slickest and perhaps most precarious section of trail in the Columbia River Gorge. Looking downstream from the falls, you can see where the two forks of Eagle Creek converge, meeting at Grand Union Falls.",

Fingers of weathered lava jut into the surf at sea level and, from a historic stone shelter at 745 feet, you can look out on the whole vista.

While you can drive to other trailheads in the Scenic Area, plan to be here on a balmy day and take your time.",

      "description": "Crater Lake is the the centerpiece of Oregon's only national park and a world-class tourist attraction. Statistics on the lake vary with the seasons, but the lake is six miles across at its widest and has a maximum depth of 1,949 feet. This makes it the deepest lake in the United States, second deepest in North America, and the ninth deepest in the world. Crater Lake is the deepest lake on the planet whose floor lies above sea level.\r\n\r\nCrater Lake is renowned for its intense blue color and its clarity. This is a result of a lack of sediment in the lake as there are no inflowing watercourses: the lake nestles within a massive caldera that filled with rain and snow melt (The area experiences some of the highest snowfall totals in the world). Most days, it is possible to see at least 100 feet below the surface.",

It can get pretty busy on summer weekends, but the meadow area is large enough for many people to camp without being on top of each other. The area is very exposed during bad weather, so keep an eye on the weather report. The shortest approach for day hikers is via the Killen Creek Trail, which rises through montane woods on a rather aggressively stepped trail before reaching lush subalpine meadows and then the Pacific Crest Trail.",

The last eruption in the area is estimated to have been around 480 A.D. The Pacific Crest Trail enters the Mount Washington Wilderness in these lava fields, and a short hike takes you on trail to the small prominence of Little Belknap Crater. On the hike and at Little Belknap’s summit, you will get views of Cascade prominences such as North and Middle Sister, The Husband, Black Butte, Mount Washington, Three Fingered Jack, and Mount Jefferson. A little farther on, you can take a well-defined user trail to the summit of Belknap Crater, which offers the same views from much higher up and invites exploration of its craters.",

You’ll descend back to Eagle Creek via the “unmaintained” Bench Canyon Trail, rough but easy to follow, passing a couple more secluded mountain lakes. Wildlife is present, but you’re most likely to see golden-mantled ground squirrels, chipmunks, red squirrels, and lots of Columbian ground squirrels in the meadows. Mule deer and elk are also common in the valleys. Up high, you’ll be lucky to see mountain goats, which generally stay away from trails",

The popularity of the spot should not detract from a visit, however, especially if you can do it mid-week. All up the trail, meadows are blooming in mid-summer, there are waterfalls to explore as you ascend Adam Creek, and Ice Lake itself is a tranquil oasis below the Wallowas’ highest ridge. Some will do Ice Lake, and even the Matterhorn, as a long day hike; others will prefer the repose of an evening or two in the wilderness on the shores of this high lake",
