Crater Lake is the deepest lake on the planet whose floor lies above sea level.\r\n\r\nCrater Lake is renowned for its intense blue color and its clarity. This is a result of a lack of sediment in the lake as there are no inflowing watercourses: the lake nestles within a massive caldera that filled with rain and snow melt (The area experiences some of the highest snowfall totals in the world). Most days, it is possible to see at least 100 feet below the surface.",

            "description" : "Ice Lake is one of the most coveted destinations in the Wallowas and, as such, campsites can be at a premium on summer weekends, when overnighters have their sights set on bagging the Matterhorn’s marble summit (see Matterhorn Add-on Hike). The popularity of the spot should not detract from a visit, however, especially if you can do it mid-week. All up the trail, meadows are blooming in mid-summer, there are waterfalls to explore as you ascend Adam Creek, and Ice Lake itself is a tranquil oasis below the Wallowas’ highest ridge. Some will do Ice Lake, and even the Matterhorn, as a long day hike; others will prefer the repose of an evening or two in the wilderness on the shores of this high lake",
