This is not a technical ride by any means,, it is just a great workout and quite a scenic tour. The trail is mostly rolling hills,, up and down,, few roots from trees to go over,, and lots of cinder and volcanic ash all over. Soft terrain. The last 3-4 miles is a downhill bomber,, with a few rail road tie sized wood to jump over. Then that dumps right out into the parking lot.  Nice ride.",

      "description": "This trail follows the western side of the Deschutes River for the first 12.5 miles then crosses to the Sun River side. Heading south on this trail is traveling upstream on the river thus some elevation is gained, about 300 ft going this direction. This is a very well planned and built trail that runs through several park areas along the river that can be very busy with other users at times. Most all of these areas are accessed off of Road 41 and offer numerous starting points. Along the section between the Big Eddy Rec site and Dillon Falls (about 2.5 miles) there are a couple different routes all marked by different signage, there are also maps at all the kiosks along the way. Although the route nearest the river is always open to MTB through here it is encouraged to use the alternate MTB route during high use times- summer weekends, holidays, etc.The trail itself is a great singletrack that climbs and descends ridges as it follows the river. There is a little technical area within the first couple miles but after that it is a fantastic novice/intermediate ride through the woods. Scenery along the way is incredible, with many waterfalls, lava rock formations and wildlife to see. As you near Benham Falls there are a couple trails heading west away from the river, these climb up to Benham Butte and beyond. Following the river trail past Benham Falls brings you to a footbridge across the river and another 2.5 miles of great trail to Sun River. A left turn after the footbridge will lead along the Blackrock trail through the lava fields 4 miles to the Lava Lands Visitor Center on Highway 97.",
      "directions": "From Bend drive west on Highway 46 towards Mt Bachelor. At mile 5 Bachelor View dr is on the left, this is a private dr however there is room for a few vehicles near the entrance, trail takes off west under the power line. Option #2; at mile 5.5 turn left into small, dirt parking area. Popular with dog walkers and joggers there are a few different trails that start here but all lead over the ridge and down to the river- follow the one with most bike tracks.The other end of this trail is well marked within the Golf Community of Sun River, south of Bend.",

Even the other trails in the region that aren't actually part of the Phil's Trail System feed into or connect to trails that feed into Phil's.According to the locals, and for the purpose of our trail listings, the boundaries of the Phil's Area Trail System is a square comprised of Skyliners Road to the north, Highway 46 (Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway) to the south, Bend to the east, and the Storm King trail to the west.This complex trail system offers a variety of different trails, but on average the trails are very buff, very flowy, with some great corners to rail. The trail tread is quite loose and sandy, and gets very dry, especially late in the season, leading to moon dust conditions. Here and there you'll find some rock gardens, skinnies, and sections of flow trail with big jumps and massive berms! All of the difficult sections do feature ride arounds, making this an extremely beginner-friendly area.",

Most anything particularly challenging will have a ‘ride around’ option for those not comfortable with the challenge.

      "description": "An all singletrack route with great scenery through fun terrain, sharing trails that double as x-country ski trails in the winter. These are singletrack but are wider and flatter than most MTB trails. There are large brown signs within the Snow Park area marking the ski routes and although good for determining location they can mislead someone on a MTB route, once again a map of the area comes in really handy. Immediately upon setting off from the parking area you will come across a Y and one of these brown signs telling you the Swedes Ridge Loop is to the right- in order to avoid a lot of dirt road riding take a left here and follow the trail 2 miles all the way to the Swampy Lakes Shelter, passing a few other singletracks along the way. The trail leading north behind the shelter will lead you down 1000â€™ to the Tumalo Falls area. Staying on the Swedes Ridge Loop the trail from here gets tighter and more technical. Stay left at the next intersection (signed) and follow the trail 2 miles out the ridge on a fast & twisty trail with plenty of opportunities for viewing the surrounding mountains and canyon below. The trail suddenly stops at a FS road at the ridges point, lots of good views here. There is the option here for continuing on straight all the way down to join in the Philâ€™s Trail Network some 6 miles away. To stay on the Swedes Loop look right as soon as you hit the road, there is an unmarked singletrack disappearing back into the trees not more than 20 yards away. This is another fun section of tight trail through dense trees. Drops, switchbacks and a couple man-made skinnies await the rider along this 1.5 mile section until the route joins back in with a ski trail. Another 1.5 miles farther and you come to a 4-way intersection, go straight through this for another half mile and you come back to the main trail that heads to Swampy Lakes Shelter you started on, go left and its 1 fun mile back down to the parking area.

Basically this is an 18 mile loop with no less than 12 â€˜connectorâ€™ trails running between the two sides, PT West &amp; PT East- the ride lengths and different configurations here are almost endless. The local bike shop boasts 28 miles of trails, I guess so if you were to ride them all. The local bike shops and the Forest Service office have free maps available. Like the neighboring systems in Bend all the intersections are marked by a post with a number on it, these correspond with the maps- as you are riding along these #â€™s are not necessarily in order so having a map, at least for the first time here is kind of important.Although not direction specific I chose to ride the loop counter-clockwise (turning right at every intersection) and for the first 2.5 miles the trail was just a twisty, flat ride through the woods, great for the novice riders. After that there was a slight elevation gain and some semi-technical spots mainly in the form of small rock gardens. The views from the ridge of the surrounding mountains are spectacular. At intersection #28, about 8.5 miles from the start you will want to turn left onto PT East, turning right here leads to the Upper Metolius trail- it is possible to ride singletrack from here all the way to the numerous trail systems in Bend. Back on the loop the trail turns very fast and winds its way back down the ridge towards Sisters. Take a left at intersection #2 near the end as going right will take you to the Five Pine Resort (this is plainly marked). There are several FS roads running through this area and you will cross them frequently, however this trail is all singletrack and if you find yourself riding on a road you somehow missed a turn-These are very well planned and built trails and the signage is some of the best I have ever seen on a system this size.",

This part of the trail is called the Suttle Lake Tie trail.  It rides very fast and winds through beautiful woodland.  The first mile nearest the lake does get pretty tight with dense shrubbery whacking at you so maneuver carefully.  The trail is quite smooth and very negotiable for beginners nonetheless.  A few sandy areas might trip you up in a few spots during dry months.  Since I was staying at Suttle Lake at the time I just traveled the trail to the connection point of the Black Butte Loops and then back again.  The descent from Suttle Lake was gradual enough that the return trip was only slightly more difficult.   I definitely will be coming back to explore further.  From the Sherman Creek turnoff and Black Butte Loops you can also connect to a trail that takes you to Sisters.  I will be back to experience those trails soon.",

The two trails share a common pathway for the initial 0.5 miles which then forks high atop either side of the creek's ravine and continue downhill to create an inverse elevation profile. Either direction you choose, you're going down right out the gate with a grueling climb back to the car.Perched 2,000 feet above the creek, both trails sweep opposite sides of the ravine's steep slope diving and stretching deeper and further into the firmament. Ancient volcanic rock fields stationed on exposed cliffside guard the eastern Oregon expanse almost as if it were Mother Nature's personal watchtower. The ground is a perfect medley of rock, root, needle-pack, volcanic moondust, and black gold. I think loam actually sums it up nicely. The Cedar Creek descent ends with a sharp ridge descent over such an amount of pumice and baby head, I hardly recognized any evidence of a trail before popping back onto clay at Fifteen Mile Creek's river bottom. The initial climb out on the 15-Mile trail begins easy enough, but shortly after the mellow grade ascent, we were met with long stretches of hillside hike-a-bike punctuated by more outcroppings of rock. Once back on top, the trail continues climbing in earnest, but can be done so pedaling all the way back to the car.",

Then it turns into State Park land and at the upper end it is Hood River County Forest land.The lower section climbs gradually along a small meandering stream crossing back and forth over it 7 times, (which is how the Seven Streams trail got it's name). Up top, there are mind blowing wooden stunts built for experts, and a really fun practice area for learning called Family Man. After the climbing effort is over, your reward is 4 miles of smooth, twisty,  screaming single-track all the way home.You can ride Post Canyon as an out &amp; back, or connect up several trails to make a super fun loop ride.
