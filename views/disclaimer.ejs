        <p>
          Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the disclaimer – the very heart of
          our hiking adventure! This is your gentle warning that the trail ahead
          is as unpredictable as life itself.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Parental Discretion Advised: This hike, much like American apple
            pie, is a beloved institution. However, be warned: the trail might
            cleanse your mind of city life and immerse you in the raw,
            unfiltered beauty of nature. No innuendo, no sarcasm – just the
            great outdoors as it truly is.
          </li>
          <li>
            Explicit Depictions of Reality: Be prepared to encounter the
            unvarnished truth of nature. Yes, that means mud, rain, bugs, and
            perhaps a critter or two. These elements are known collectively as
            "life," and they're entirely uncensored out here.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sarcasm-Free Zone: If the trail seems to mock you with its steep
            climbs and sudden drops, remember, it's not being sarcastic. Nature
            is just that straightforward. Take it all in stride – or in a hike,
            as the case may be.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dangerous Delights: Should you encounter something that seems
            thrilling yet perilous, like attempting to scale a cliff or befriend
            wildlife, remember our motto: "Do not try this at home, or at all."
            Safety first, selfies second.
          </li>
          <li>
            Offense Optional: If the ruggedness offends your sensibilities or
            the lack of Wi-Fi makes you twitch, remember, you can always turn
            back. But for those who choose to stay, the trail promises a genuine
            experience, free from the filters of modern life.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          So lace up your boots, pack your sense of adventure, and remember:
          this hike is real, it's raw, and it's waiting for you. Proceed at your
          own risk, and most importantly, enjoy the journey!
